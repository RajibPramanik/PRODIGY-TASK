## Create a Guessing Game
This is a simple number guessing game built in Java. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number. The program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The player continues guessing until they find the correct number. Once the player guesses correctly, the program will display the number of attempts it took to win.
